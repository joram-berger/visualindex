# Visual LilyPond Index

This is the source code of a
[LilyPond](http://www.lilypond.org) document that displays many notatinal objects
in one page and links to the corresponding LilyPond documentation (currently 2.19).

The PDF file compiled from this LilyPond input is available for
[download](https://joramberger.de/files/lilypond_visualindex.pdf "lilypond_visualindex.pdf")
(LilyPond 2.23: [download](https://github.com/joram-berger/visualindex/files/8239967/visualindex-2.23.pdf "visualindex-2.23.pdf")).

The goal of this page is to create an entry page which makes it easy to find the
names and the documentation of contexts, graphical objects and engravers of a
LilyPond score, in order to facilitate tweaking it. This is done by

* showing as many notational elements as possible on one page
  (at least the most important ones)
* linking the objects directly to the user manual of LilyPond
* labelling them with their LilyPond names (graphical object names)
* linking those labels to the [Internals Reference](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/internals/)
* linking also to the corresponding [engraver](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/notation/modifying-context-plug_002dins)
